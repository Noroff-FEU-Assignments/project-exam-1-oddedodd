NOROFF - Project Exam 1

## Description

Project Exam 1 in Front End Development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media was a comprehensive endeavor that involved crafting an engaging and informative blog about old computers and games. This project uses data retrieved from the WordPress API, allowing for a dynamic and content-rich experience.

Throughout this project, I had to leverage all the skills and knowledge I had acquired over the past year. The foundation of the website was built using HTML and CSS, where I applied my understanding of web standards and responsive design principles to ensure the site was accessible and visually appealing on various devices. The use of JavaScript was crucial in adding interactive elements that enhanced user engagement, such as dynamic content loading, interactive galleries, etc.

In addition to technical skills, this project required an understanding of content management systems. Using the WordPress API, I was able to efficiently manage and organize the content needed for the blog, ensuring that it was both easy to update and navigate. This involved setting up a backend structure, handling API requests, and integrating the content seamlessly into the front-end design.

Furthermore, this project was not just a test of technical abilities but also of creative and strategic thinking. I had to design a user interface that would attract and retain visitors, making the exploration of old computers and games both informative and enjoyable. This included choosing appropriate color schemes, typography, and layout structures that reflected the nostalgic theme of the blog while maintaining modern usability standards.

Overall, this project was a culmination of my learning journey over the past year, bringing together design, development, and content management skills into a single, cohesive, and engaging website. It demonstrated my ability to handle complex projects and create professional-quality web applications that meet both user needs and technical requirements.
